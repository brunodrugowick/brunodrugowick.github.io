# My Experience In a Nutshell

- **`Up to 2010`** Worked to pay the bills. Mostly IT support, some PHP.

- **`2010 - March 2015`** Developer in the ITSM industry. Worked with `BMC Remedy ITSM` suite and `BMC Atrium Orchestrator`, mostly. My roles ranged from Developer to Technical Leader towards the end of this period.

- **`March 2015 - June 2016`** Team Leader. This only added to my previous roles, acting as a promotion. My responsibilities were to develop and `coordinate a team` of around 10 people. I also took part in the company's `mentoring program` as a mentor for other professionals. 

- **`June 2016 - July 2018`** Manager. This was a big change in my career. From this point on I started working with more traditional development tools and languages. I was Manager of a Business Unit, taking part on the staff meetings and dealing with the company's strategy. During this period some of the roles I played included Scrum Master, Product Owner and Team Leader.

- **`July 2018 - January 2020`** Technology Coordinator. At this point I was fully managing the ownership, development and support of a product, I was still a Team Leader but also worked on the architecture of the application, design and code reviews. Some of the technologies I worked with (actually since 2016) were `Spring Framework`, `Thymeleaf`, `AngularJS`, `MongoDB`, `HSQLDB`, `Git`, `GitLab`...

- **`January 2020 - Present`** Chapter Leader (The Dev Chapter). Right now all my abilities are focused on development. My team is responsible for everything related to development (back/front-end, mobile), regardless of being a internal component, a product or a client solution. A broader spectrum of technologies are now part of my life.

Well, that's my experience `in a nutshell` and every experience mentioned above, even before 2010, was rich and valuable and made me into the professional I'm today.
