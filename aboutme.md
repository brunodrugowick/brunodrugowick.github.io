# My Experience In a Nutshell

- **`Up to 2010`** Worked to pay the bills. Mostly IT support, some PHP.

- **`2010 - March 2015`** Developer on the ITSM industry. Worked with `BMC Remedy ITSM` suite and `BMC Atrium Orchestrator`, mostly. My roles ranged from Developer to Technical Leader towards the end of this period.

- **`March 2015 - June 2016`** Team Leader. This added to my previous roles as a promotion. My responsibilities were to develop and `coordinate a team` of around 10 people. I also took part in the company's `mentoring program` since them. 

- **`June 2016 - July 2018`** Manager. This was a big change in my carrer. From this point on I started working with more traditional development tools and languages. I was Manager of a Business Unit, taking part on the staff meetings and dealing with the company's strategy. During this period some of the roles I played included Scrum Master, Product Owner and Team Leader.

- **`July 2018 - Present`** Technology Coordinator. Now fully managing the development and support for a product, I still act as a Team Leader but also work on the architecture of the application, design and code reviews. Some of the technologies I work with (actually since 2016) are `Spring Framework`, `Thymeleaf`, `AngularJS`, `MongoDB`, `HSQLDB`, `Git`, `GitLab`...

Well, that's `in a nutshell`, but every experience mentioned above, even before 2010, was/is important and made me into the professional I'm today.
