# Project Overview: the Basic Microservices Architecture with Spring Cloud

This post presents the basic architecture of an online flower shop in a microservices architecture. I have no intention to provide detailed information on each component on this post.

I do provide a working example of a microservices application based on [Spring Cloud](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud) project. I also provide a basic explanation of the components' responsibilities and how they achieve that, which I believe is a good way to understand the microservices architecture.
