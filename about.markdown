I used to have my work experience on this page, but that's limiting. You can always go to my Linkedin (link below) for that.

At the same time, if I start to talk about my whole self here, that's also going to be limiting. Yes, I'm confused like that! That is my motto, actually: _Constantly confused_. I have a t-shirt with that written in a fancy font.

To really talk about myself I'd have to have a personal blog or something, so I can talk about myself while I, myself, change. And here, the idea is to talk about some tech stuff that I like to do.

Well, I started this text trying not to talk about myself, but that and the three paragraphs above end up saying a lot about myself, I think.

Yeah, that's me... :)
